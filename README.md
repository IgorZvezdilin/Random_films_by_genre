#### This is the console app, which return random film of a certain genre into console, when user input genre. 

#### I divided js code by __three__ parts. __objFilms.js__ - contain an object, which contain genres and films, divided by genres. __UserInput.js__  - to get users choise and __script.js__ - this is a logic of my project. Right now i start to learn front-end programming, and in this projects  I try to use my knowledge to solve this task.
